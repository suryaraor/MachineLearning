# Scalar Tensors: Introduction and Hands-On

## What Are Scalar Tensors?
- **Definition**: Scalars are single numeric values with no dimensions (e.g., `25` or `3.5`).
- **Notation**: Typically denoted by lowercase, italic letters (e.g., `x`).
- **Data Types**: Scalars can be integers (e.g., `int32`) or floats (e.g., `float32`), depending on the library or context.

## Hands-On Creation in Python

### Libraries Used:
1. **NumPy**: A basic library for numerical operations.
2. **PyTorch**: A Pythonic library optimized for GPUs, widely used in machine learning.
3. **TensorFlow**: A production-oriented library with extensive support for distributed systems.

### Examples:
#### 1. **Base Python**:
- Scalars like `25` are simple numeric values.
- Adding two scalars (e.g., `25 + 3`) results in another scalar.
- **Type Compatibility**: Mixing integers and floats results in a float.

#### 2. **NumPy**:
- Allows explicit type specification, such as `float32` or `int64`.

#### 3. **PyTorch**:
- Similar to NumPy but optimized for GPU operations.
- Provides better usability and debug-friendly features compared to TensorFlow.

#### 4. **TensorFlow**:
- Scalars are created with wrappers like `tf.Variable`.
- Though feature-rich, TensorFlow is less intuitive and has a steeper learning curve than PyTorch.
